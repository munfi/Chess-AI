# Chess-AI
A very crude chess AI that will undergo continuous development over my education.

Project is under the form of a unity project - will need to be opened in the unity editor for now.

Will produce a short video of its functionality shortly

If you're mainly interested in the programming, the code can be found in Assets > Scripts.
99% of the code takes place in the file "game".

My coding skills have improved significantly as I worked on this, thus the code prior to line 1200 is incredibly crude.
It's only past that point where you'll find code I'm even mildly happy with.
